Jackson Brazeau 041038729 Pokedex project
Part 2 Description:
For my capstone mockup I decided to go with a clean and simple layout so that the colors will be focued on the pokemon and logo itself. I did 2 x 3 layout for the mobile and 3 x 7 for the desktop layout, also a generate pokemon button at the top under the logo and load more button at the bottom to display more pokemon.
